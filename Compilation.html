                    <h1>Brief History</h1>
                    <p>Computer science is a recent discipline that talks about algorithmics, mathematics, science and many more. There is no birthday to when Computer science became a discipline as a lot of people believe in various dates. One could say that it was born in the 1600s or the 1800s, however a lot would agree that it started in the 1960s. It was spearheaded by both Alan Turing and Kurtz Godel with their mathematical and algorithmic works, which was the same as Ada Lovelace’s algorithms 60 years earlier. 
                        Soon later other mathematicians such as John von Neumann would help in the evolution of Computer science into the present one we have.</p>

                    <p>Dating back approximately 5,000 years in ancient Babylonia, number systems were in use, though not in the same manner as today. Instead, they employed a weighted positional system.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Mathematics defines it as a method for representing, expressing, and writing numerical values based on their measurements. 
                        This system employs symbols to depict different types of numbers within a specific set and has been utilized for thousands of years to aid in various mathematical calculations.</p>

                    <h1>What are the Types of Number Systems?</h1>
                    <p>Here is the list of the type of Number Systems:</p>
                    <li>Binary Number System</li>
                    <li>Octal Number System</li>
                    <li>Decimal Number System</li>
                    <li>Hexadecimal Number System</li>
                    <br>
                    <h1>Binary Number System</h1>
                    <p>It resembles the Decimal system, but it utilizes only two numeral symbols, which is why it’s called “Binary.” These two numbers are 0 and 1.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Binary code is extensively utilized in electronic computers because all data inputted is automatically transformed into binary format. Computers rely on binary calculations, which is why they convert all data into this format for efficient storage, management, and processing.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h1>Octal Number System</h1>
                    <p>The octal number system operates on a base-8 framework, utilizing the digits 0 through 7. This system represents a unique numerical set. When decomposing octal numbers, they can be converted into binary form by grouping three binary digits (0s and 1s) together to create a single octal unit.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h1>Decimal Number System</h1>
                    <p>A number system that employs digits from 0 to 9 operates on a base-10 framework. In this system, each digit's value is determined by its position, with each digit representing ten times the value of the digit to its immediate right. 
                        For instance, the number "5634" can be expressed mathematically as follows: (5 x 1000) + (6 x 100) + (3 x 10) + (4 x 1).</p>
                    <br>
                    <h1>Hexadecimal Number System</h1>
                    <p>The hexadecimal system utilizes 16 digits to represent base 16 numbers, encompassing digits from 0 to 15. Values exceeding 9 are denoted by letters rather than numeric symbols; for instance, 10 is represented as A, 11 as B, and this pattern continues up to 15. 
                        Furthermore, in contrast to the octal system, hexadecimal numbers are grouped in binary form using four digits instead of three.</p>

                    <p>It was released back in 1999 and was created by Intel as an additional specification for the Micro-ATX motherboard and is the smallest variation of the ATX family. 
                        Its intended design was to create more variations of new PC designs, especially for budget PCs.</p>

                    <br>

                    <h1 class="Port4_Comp">NLX Motherboard</h1>
                    <p>A low-profile motherboard created by Intel and other collaborators back in 1987. It was designed as a replacement for the nonstandard LPX motherboard. It contains new features and new supports for the latest of technologies. 
                        However the NLX motherboard went into the same route as the BLX motherboard, it was never widely accepted by the people.</p>

                    <br>

                    <h1 class="Port4_Comp">First Generation of Computers (1945-1955)</h1>
                    <p>Computers were not mainstream and were restricted to only military usages. In this generation computers were different to its modern counterparts, it was characterized by its use of vacuum tubes as its main component making it relatively huge. 
                        At this time, computers were unreliable, had a high rate of failure, were expensive, and had a ton of cooling problems.</p>
                    
                    <br>

                    <h1 class="Port4_Comp">First Generation of Computers (1955-1965)</h1>
                    <p>This decade invented one of the main components that would define the computer, the transistor. The transistor is the fundamental building block when it comes to computer circuitry, it allows the computer to operate in a binary system as the transistor acts as the switches representing both 1 and 0. 
                        Furthermore the transistor was a major replacement for the vacuum tubes as it was seen as smaller, faster, and more reliable. Another thing that was invented was programming languages, specifically COBOL (Common Business Oriented Language) and FORTRAN (Formula Translator). Magnetic tapes were also created as a storage device.</p>
                    
                    <br>

                    <h1 class="Port4_Comp">Third Generation of Computers (1965-1975)</h1>
                    <p>Transistors were upgraded and integrated into the IC commonly known as Integrated circuits. It is a small silicon chip whose power requirement is extremely small resulting in computers being faster, smaller, and reliable than before. 
                        Additionally Magnetic tapes were replaced with the Magnetic discs.</p>
                    
                    <br>

                    <h1 class="Port4_Comp">Fourth Generation of Computers (1976-Present)</h1>
                    <p>VLSI technology was developed and has become a crucial element in the creation of the modern devices we rely on today. This innovation enabled the production of smaller, cost-effective, yet powerful computers, leading to the development of microprocessors. 
                        Also referred to as CPUs, microprocessors are a vital component of computers, as it incorporates key components such as the Arithmetic and Logic Unit, registers, and the control unit.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p>Additionally, during this period, significant inventions like the command-driven interface, used for computer interaction, and the Graphical User Interface (GUI), which made the computer more user-friendly.</p>
                    
                    <br>

                    <h1 class="Port4_Comp">Fifth Generation of Computers (1990-Present)</h1>
                    <p>Computers in this generation are to be one of the most fastests and more resembles our current 21st century computers. 
                        It has the ability to perform parallel processing and the concept of A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) was introduced to allow devices to operate on themselves.</p>
