                    <p>The topic presented in class as well as the countless information I gathered from my research allowed me to gain knowledge and an understanding on the disciplines of computer science as well as its history. Computer Science is a brand new academic discipline recognized in the 1960s and has evolved rapidly over the years due to the introduction of technological advancements. From what I have understood, Computer Science is not only all about programming software and implementing new features, it's much broader than that and it includes software testing, theories, Data analysis, Mathematical algorithms and so much more. 
                        It’s quite fascinating to me that Computer Science evolved into the Computer Science we now know today and is a central part in our society and the development of new technologies in the future despite it not yet a century old. In the future for me, Computer Science will become the major drive of advancing humanity into its next stage of development and hopefully brings prosperity to everyone in the future.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Computing has been divided into 5 Disciplines and Majors and these are Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Software Engineering, Information Systems, and Information Technology. Each of these Disciplines and Majors has intersecting areas in their fields however each of them works in a specific task and responsibility despite working in the same area as the other. Like Computer Science and Software Engineering, both tackle programming but in different ways. Computer science is more into algorithms and theories while Software Engineering is more into practical skills. Meanwhile the rest of the Disciplines and Majors focuses a lot on network infrastructure, data management, and Hardware. 
                        So in short all of these listed Disciplines and Majors are a key to managing and developing technology in today's era. Each has their own responsibilities and tasks to do both in software and hardware development. </p>

                    <p>Reading and gathering all the information for the portfolio made me learn more about the systems that we used on a daily basis. The complexity of each system designed to automate human work, simplify intricate items and information, and the ability to access and store data and convert them into information. 
                        So much of humanity has changed over the century, the technological advancements they made to create the modern age we know of today.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Information Systems has changed the way we communicate and understand our surroundings. But most importantly, how we handle, store, receive, and transact data and information. We started with writings on stone tablets and paper to news reporting to broadcasting and to now through the Internet. Information is now an accessibility to anyone who has access to a mobile device and to the internet. Information can now be easily stored in databases and be protected by people who are experts in this field. Other fields such as medical are in need of these systems to support them in their work. Another is the military to assist them in strategies based on the situation. 
                        Basically the introduction of Information Systems and other computer fields changed our lives a lot, most especially in the academic fields, businesses, military, and in governance.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Information Systems are divided into four systems. These systems are: Transaction Processing System (TPS), Management Information System (MIS), Decision Support System (DSS), and Executive Information System (EIS). Each of these systems has their own usages and purpose like the Transaction Processing System mainly used for payments and transactions. Machines that use this system are your typical ATMs, order systems, and seat reservations. Another is the Executive Information System used by people on the top echelon. These systems are highly used in business, corporations, and organizations. 
                        They are a key in the deciding matter of where they want the company to head to as well as goals that they want to achieve. Its an important aspect in businesses as it will help in managing and having clear goals in the company.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>So overall, the technological advancement humanity has made in the span of a century has changed the way we live our lives, for the better and for the worse. Every invention has a consequence to it and systems like these can be used for malicious purposes. However it is still an amazing advancement and hopefully in the near future of humanity these problems will be kept at a minimum at best.</p>

                    <p>Through extensive research on this topic, I find it intriguing that the devices we utilize daily are fundamentally supported by intricate systems. These systems comprise an array of numerical frameworks capable of detecting, compiling, storing, retrieving, and manipulating data, all of which work in concert to produce functional machinery and software. Each system serves a specific purpose and executes designated tasks to ensure both operational efficiency and quality of life for users.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The various types of numerical systems are distinct in their functionalities, and they complement one another to create effective programs or enhance human readability. They can store vast amounts of information within databases, accommodating terabytes of data. This is particularly fascinating, considering that such information is housed within secure facilities featuring advanced security mechanisms, capable of managing billions of data points. In contrast, information storage in the early 1900s relied on paper—either handwritten or printed—making retrieval challenging and necessitating physical storage in cabinets or rooms. The technological leap from that era to the present, achieved within just over a century, is truly remarkable. 
                        The complexity of the mechanisms, programs, and machinery developed during this time has seamlessly integrated into our daily lives.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In summary, these systems underpin the technology that shapes our everyday experiences, facilitating tasks and enhancing our quality of life. Without these foundational systems, computers and electronic devices would not resemble the sophisticated tools we recognize today. We are fortunate that these advancements were made, as they have ushered in an era rich with technological innovation.</p>

                    <p>When it comes to solving complicated problems or storing a ton of information or browsing around the internet a computer is your main buddy on these tasks. Now, What is a Computer? They are machines that consist of different components that when combined, turns into a utility that takes the majority of the human tasks and makes them more convenient and efficient to do. It has become the center point of our society and will continue to be in the center as we become more and more reliant on it, especially on advancing through technology, scientific breakthroughs, and preservation of old and new information. However, all of these tasks would have not been possible if it wasn’t for the creation of software. Software is a collection of programs that instructs, plans, executes, manages, and performs tasks. 
                        Both software and hardware work in tandem together as without the other one, the one left has no functions or uses.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Now how central has these computers become in our society? Well they have been integrated into other sectors of sciences, engineering, as well as other jobs like cashiers, office workers, and many more. Majority of the day to day activities and jobs that humans are doing have a computer or some sort of machine that is either assisting them in their task or is doing the majority of the leg work.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Overall, Computers and software have become a fundamental part of our daily lives, prevalent throughout society. They are utilized by individuals both at home and in the workplace for communication, information acquisition, and data storage. Without computers and software, our ability to connect, access information, enjoy entertainment, and pursue education would be severely restricted. Progress would be slow, challenging, and tedious, making demanding tasks/jobs even more arduous. Computers have transformed our lives and how we function, impacting us for the better or for the worse.</p>
